/** \file shared/report.h
 * Contains reporting functions.
 *\verbatim
 *
 * To enable the debug() function on all of the software, just type:
 * ./configure --enable-debug
 * and recompile with 'make'
 *
 * To enable the debug() function only in specific files:
 * 1) Configure without enabling debug (that is without --enable-debug)
 * 2) Edit the source file that you want to debug and put the following
 *    line at the top, before the #include "report.h" line:
 *    #define DEBUG
 * 3) Then recompile with 'make'
 *
 * This way, the global DEBUG macro is off but is locally enabled in
 * certains parts of the software.

 *	Warning conditions: Something that the user should Fix, but the

 *	Major event in the program.
 *	Ex: (un)loading of driver, client (dis)connect.

 *
 * \def RPT_DEBUG
 *	Insignificant event.
 *	Ex: What function has been called, what subpart of a function is being
