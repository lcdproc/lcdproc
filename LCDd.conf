# LCDd.conf -- configuration file for the LCDproc server daemon LCDd
#
# This file contains the configuration for the LCDd server.
# 
# The format is ini-file-like. It is divided into sections that start at
# markers that look like [section]. Comments are all line-based comments,
# and are lines that start with '#' or ';'.
#
# The server has a 'central' section named [server]. For the menu there is
# a section called [menu]. Further each driver has a section which
# defines how the driver acts.
#
# The drivers are activated by specifiying them in a driver= line in the
# server section, like:
#
#   Driver=curses
#
# This tells LCDd to use the curses driver.
# The first driver that is loaded and is capable of output defines the
# size of the display. The default driver to use is curses.
# If the driver is specified using the -d <driver> command line option,
# the Driver= options in the config file are ignored.
#
# The drivers read their own options from the respective sections.



## Server section with all kinds of settings for the LCDd server ##
[server]

# Tells the server to load the given drivers. Multiple lines can be given.
# The name of the driver is case sensitive and determines the section
# where to look for further configuration options of the specific driver
# as well as the name of the dynamic driver module to load at runtime.
# The latter one can be changed by giving af File= directive in the
# driver specific section.
#
# The following drivers are supported:
#   bayrad, CFontz, CFontz633, CFontzPacket, curses, CwLnx, EyeboxOne,
#   g15, glcdlib, glk, hd44780, icp_a106, imon, IOWarrior, irman,
#   joy, lb216,lcdm001, lcterm, lirc,MD8800, ms6931, mtc_s16209x,
#   MtxOrb, NoritakeVFD, pyramid, sed1330, sed1520, serialVFD,
#   sli, stv5730, svga, t6963, text, tyan, ula200, xosd
Driver=curses

# Tells the driver to bind to the given interface
Bind=127.0.0.1

# Listen on this specified port; defaults to 13666.
Port=13666

# Sets the reporting level; defaults to 2 (warnings and errors only).
#ReportLevel=3

# Should we report to syslog instead of stderr ? Default: no
#ReportToSyslog=yes

# Sets the default time in seconds to displays a screen.
WaitTime=5

# User to run as.  LCDd will drop its root priviledges,
# if any, and run as this user instead.
User=nobody

# If yes, the the serverscreen will be rotated as a usual info screen. If no,
# it will be a background screen, only visible when no other screens are
# active.
#ServerScreen=no

# The server will stay in the foreground if set to true.
#Foreground=no

# Where can we find the driver modules ?
# IMPORTANT: Make sure to change this setting to reflect your
#            specific setup! Otherwise LCDd won't be able to find
#            the driver modules and will thus not be able to
#            function properly.
# NOTE: Always place a slash as last character !
DriverPath=server/drivers/

# The "...Key=" lines define what the server does with keypresses that
# don't go to any client.
# These are the defaults:
ToggleRotateKey=Enter
PrevScreenKey=Left
NextScreenKey=Right
#ScrollUpKey=Up
#ScrollDownKey=Down

# If you have only 4 keys, you can choose to use this:
#ToggleRotateKey=Enter
#PrevScreenKey=Up
#NextScreenKey=Down

# If you have only 3 keys, you can choose to use this:
#ToggleRotateKey=Enter
#PrevScreenKey=Up



## The menu section. The menu is an internal LCDproc client. ##
[menu]
# You can configure what keys the menu should use. Note that the MenuKey
# will be reserved exclusively, the others work in shared mode.

# The following works excellent with 4 keys or more.
MenuKey=Escape
EnterKey=Enter
UpKey=Up
DownKey=Down
# If you have 6 keys you may define these as well
#LeftKey=Left
#RightKey=Right

# If you have only 3 keys, you could use something like this:
#MenuKey=Escape
#EnterKey=Enter
#DownKey=Down
