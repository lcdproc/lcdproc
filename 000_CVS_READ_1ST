Hey, thanks for reading this first! :)

*** NOTICE ****************************************************
This is a development version of LCDproc, straight from the CVS
repository.

THIS VERSION OF LCDproc IS *NOT* GUARANTEED TO RUN, OR EVEN
COMPILE! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!
***************************************************************

With that out of the way, welcome to the bleeding edge of LCDproc.
To build and run this version, you'll need autoconf 2.59 or higher
and friends installed.

Run:

$ sh ./autogen.sh

This produces the configure script and supporting files. Once the above
command has run, the rest is pretty standard:

$ ./configure --help
[read about the options, figure out what to use]
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-drivers=curses,CFontz
[replace curses,CFontz with comma-separated list of drivers you want]
$ make
$ su
$ make install
[make install is OPTIONAL ... might not want to replace a stable
version of LCDproc with a development release]

Patches and suggestions are welcome! Join the mailing list to get
started. See http://lcdproc.org/ for more information.
