Known Bugs:
--------------
V0.4-pre1:
   - The server tends to crash if the joystick driver is the last one loaded.
     Specifically, if the "E" key is pressed...
   - The lcdproc client doesn't have a disk screen.
   - Menus are not implemented.
   - Scrollers are not implemented.
   - Dynamic driver adding/removing is not implemented.
   - LCDproc needs more documentation!

But, it's pretty stable considering I rewrote 400k of source since the
last release...
