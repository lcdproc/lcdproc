Stuff planned for future releases...  (in no particular order)

Feel free to help out with any of this stuff!  :)


----------------------------------------
Client driver

An LCDproc client can connect, request the "client" driver, then get
all screen information sent to it!  This allows things such as logging
in remotely and starting up a curses display of LCDproc.  It also
gives another method for writing drivers.  In a sense, it could even
let you write and link in new drivers without having to recompile and
restart LCDproc...

Another bonus is that LCDproc will come with a client which can, for
example, start up a "client" driver to send "keypresses" from the
command line.  Or, 
	
	lcdtool -key A

would have the same result as pressing a key on the keypad.


----------------------------------------
Menus / Client menus

LCDproc will have a "menu" mode, where various options can be
configured.  You can rearrange the screenlist, change the contrast,
add/remove drivers, change screen priorities, kick off clients, etc...  

You can also access client menus to configure options in each client.

----------------------------------------
Config Files...

LCDproc will use a config file for its parameters, like other
programs; instead of relying upon long command lines.  Keypresses,
drivers, and other things will be configurable here.  Also, LCDproc
will have the ability to load/modify/save config files via its menu
interface, so you don't have to edit it by hand.

Info about particular clients/screens will also be stored in the
LCDproc config file, so you can (for example) save your preferences
about screen priorities, etc...

Code will be made generic, so that other programs can use it for their
own config files.  Clients may want to use this..

----------------------------------------
Scheduling modes

Instead of the simplistic "round robin" circular screen-scheduling in
the current release, later versions will offer several different
algorithms for screen-ordering.

One example: High-priority screens will be shown more often than
low-priority screens, simply by showing up more often.

----------------------------------------
Shell Commands

The server will also be able to run arbitrary shell commands from the
config file.  This will allow you to, for example, shut down the
machine, get online, or other system tasks.

----------------------------------------
Improved display driver API

The desirable aspects of what a driver should do has changed somewhat
since I first read the LCD manual.  The driver spec is based largely
on the functions MtxOrb's LCDs provide easily, but it is not
well-suited to other types of display.

So, I'll be working on a new driver spec which is more flexible and
more powerful.  In addition, I'm looking for ways to better handle
multiple driver devices.

----------------------------------------
Anonymous CVS

I want to *really* open up LCDproc development, by giving everyone
access to the CVS repository.  But, alas, I've got to figure out how
to set up a CVS server first...  (or convince Gareth to do it..  :)
