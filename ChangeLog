Key:  
     - Something removed
     + Something added
     * Something changed / fixed

Coming soon: (?) (my list of stuff to do soon...)
 + Client menus
 + Configuration file support
 * Better syntax for driver parameters
 * Dynamically-loaded driver system

v0.4.2:
 + Added --waittime server argument.  You can now specify how long
   a screen should stay on the display.  The default is 64 ticks or
   8 seconds.
 + Fixed compile problems on non-Linux platforms where cfmakeraw,
   CBAUD, and ioperm don't exist.  All drivers now use the same code
   to initialize a serial port.
v0.4.1:
 + Changed protocol to 0.3 because we now accept both -foo and foo
   as argument introducers.  in 0.4-pre10, these were changed
   from foo to -foo and this broke many clients.  This change
   should fix that and be backward/forward compatible.
 + Added a noop function to the protocol.  This is useful for writing
   shell script clients of LCDproc.
 + Changed the shared sock_send_string function to NOT send the
   ending NUL ('\0') byte with the string.  This was confusing
   in Perl clients which saw NUL's as the first character of
   each reply.  WARNING: The LCDPROC client depended on this
   behavior, your client may too.  Use the newline instead.
   See the code in clients/lcdproc/main.c (look for "switch(buf[i])")
   to see one way to handle this.  This should allow new clients
   to connect to old servers and vice-versa.
 + Messed with include structure in .c files.  It should no longer
   be necessary to specify ../.. to get to shared code headers.
   Also, since we are using automake, the global config.h can be
   found with just #include "config.h" as it's location is included
   in a -I to the compilers.  As a result "make distcheck" now works.
 + Added support for client_add_key and friends.  Clients MUST now
   request keys to get notified.  Keys are NO LONGER broadcast to all
   clients.  Keys are now tied to a SCREEN and CLIENT.  There are new
   commands (screen_add_key, screen_del_key) to bind keys to a
   screen. If the current screen has requested the key just pressed,
   the client gets the key and no other client gets it.  If the current
   screen has not requested the current key, then the key is broadcast
   to all clients who requested that key with client_add_key.  Clients
   might want to request a "hotkey" with client_add_key so they will
   be notified of that key no matter what screen is currently on the
   display, and then request whatever other keys a screen uses with
   screen_add_key.
 + Added driver for Matrix Orbital GLK12232-25 graphical display.
   Display is run in text mode since there isn't enough information in
   the widgets.  If we knew the max width/height of an hbar/vbar, we
   could use graphical vbar/hbar's.  Oh well.  BigNums' look really
   cool though.  You'll need some additional characters in the "Small Font"
   font (and the BigNumbers font) for this to work.
 + Rewrote Big Number Clock function in chrono.c.  Many problems with
   it have been fixed.  It now uses number value 10 to display a colon
   in between the digits.  Don't know what this will do on a the MtxOrb
   driver.  GLK driver draws a colon.
 + Cleaned up the CPU GRAPH (G) function in cpu.c and made get_load take
   a 'struct load' from the caller to save the last time values.  This
   allows two callers (CPU GRAPH and CPU LOAD) to call get_load and
   both get reaosonable values.  Without this, CPU GRAPH was always
   getting 0 because it was called immediatly after CPU LOAD called
   get_load and no clock ticks had gone by.
 + Changed --enable-debug autoconf option to be processed correctly.
   Debug now turns on -g and turns off -O6
 + Lots of other little fixes.

v0.4-pre10:
 + Metar client added (Weather information)
 + Linux infrared control (LIRC) driver added.
 + "rotating slash" heartbeat mode (looks weird on CFontz displays)
   Use "screen_set s -heartbeat slash" to use this.
 * Switched to client-server protocol V0.2, so arguments can come in
   any order, and require a "-" on the front.  Instead of
   "widget_set s w 1 2 foo", use "widget_set s w -x 1 -y 2 -text foo".
 * Server info screen no longer enabled by default.
 * Merged Andrew McMeikan's HD44780 driver changes
 - Removed WHATSNEW
 + Added ChangeLog (okay, fine, I renamed WHATSNEW and typed a few
   entries into it :)

V0.4-pre9:
 * small fixes for irix
 * Added flag in LCDd to shut off server screen:  
 	"-i off" or "--serverinfo off"
 + Wirz SLI driver
 + 16x2 support (server only)
 + MtxOrb generic output support in driver
 * Misc libc5 fixes
 + support for arbitrary display sizes; anything 16-80 characters
   wide, and 2-25 characters tall.  (doesn't work if you try to use
   a display size bigger than your LCD..  :)
 * curses driver looks slightly better (titles)
 * sizes > 20x4 no longer crash

V0.4-pre8:
 * LCDd gives more updated info in the connect string: 
	cell size, lcd dimensions.
 * bargraphs are now the correct length on CFontz displays, in the main
   lcdproc client.  For other clients, please parse the connect string!
 * MtxOrb driver supports simultaneous vbars/hbars now, with a
   mechanism to automatically use custom characters for as many
   as possible.
 + 20x2 support in LCDd!  Use "--type 20x2".
	(LCDd --type 20x2 -d MtxOrb )
 * LCDd can change backlight brightness instead of shutting it "off"
 * HD44780 should work again (LCDd forks earlier now.. oops  :)
 + 20x2 support in lcdproc client for the following screens:
	C G T M X D B S U A
   Support will not be added for K and O screens.
 + BSD support (?)
 * 20x4 screens should display correctly on 40x4 displays

V0.4-pre7: new driver
 + CrystalFontz (CFontz) LCD driver added
 * Backlight control improved
 + Brightness control added

V0.4-pre6:
 + Backlight control added.  Modes so far are "on", "off", and "open".
   Client commands are "on", "off", "toggle", "blink", and "flash".
 * Main clients' screen titles now include hostname
 + New sample client: fortune.pl
 * Added changes from David Glaude:
 + IRman support
 + Big Digit support (MtxOrb driver doesn't display it correctly yet)
 + Big cloc[K] screen
 * MtxOrb serial speed is configurable with "--speed"
 * misc bugfixes
 + ... more

V0.4-pre5:
 * Fixed bug which could take server down with a dead client
 * Fixed small scroller bug
 + Added "frame" widgets..  use "-in <frame_name>" after widget_add
   to put something in a frame.
 + The disk screen is back!
 - Frame rendering isn't finished..  the renderer probably needs a
   complete rewrite.  Any volunteers?  :)

V0.4-pre4:
 + Server menus (fairly small so far)
 + Ability to shut down, reboot, change some options, etc (menu only)
 * Driver arguments no longer required
 * Curses driver doesn't start server in background any more...
 * Argument handling fixed...
 * Drivers support "--help" for command-line info

V0.4-pre3:
 + Scroller widgets
 * Proper errno messages...
 * "make install" should work now
 * Joystick driver allows key remapping
 + Screen "durations" are actually *used* now.  (oops)
 + Initial support for screen priorities (strict priority queue)
 * Misc (but annoying!) bugs fixed, which hadn't yet affected anything
 + Drivers support parameters now (MtxOrb, joy, at least)


V0.4-pre2:
 * Memory leaks fixed
 + Memory "top" screen (S)
 + Titles now autoscroll
 * Fixed small screen-visibility bug  (clients weren't always
   notified of screen cycles)
 + Heartbeat modes implemented.  Clients can remove it with
	     widget_del my_screen heartbeat
   or turn it back on with
	     widget_add my_screen heartbeat " "
   Note that the client only has control over this when the heartbeat
   is in "open" mode.  (currently, it always is)


V0.4-pre1:
 * Too much to mention...
