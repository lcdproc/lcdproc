The SDEC LCDs are interfaced to the appliance using a parallel port. All lines
are hard-wired by Watchguard.
The LCD displays are 20 characters wide and 2 lines high, and 
have 4 buttons: <literal>Up</literal>, <literal>Down</literal>,
<literal>Left</literal>, and <literal>Right</literal>. The SDEC model number is
<literal>LMC-S2D20-01</literal>. There is a back light that can be controlled
by software. Due to its low half-life, the driver tries to keep the light off a
short while after buttons have been pressed.
